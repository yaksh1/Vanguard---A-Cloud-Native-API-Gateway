Of course. Here is a detailed README for the third project, the **High-Performance API Gateway**.

# Vanguard: A Cloud-Native API Gateway

**Vanguard** is a lightweight, high-performance, and asynchronous API Gateway built with Python and FastAPI. Designed to be the single entry point for a cloud-native microservices architecture, Vanguard provides dynamic routing, rate limiting, and authentication out-of-the-box.

Its core design principle is seamless integration with Kubernetes, enabling real-time service discovery and zero-configuration routing for services deployed within a cluster. It's built to handle high-concurrency traffic with minimal latency, offering a powerful alternative to heavier, more complex gateway solutions.

## Architecture

Vanguard sits at the edge of the network, proxying all incoming client requests to the appropriate backend services. It operates entirely in a non-blocking fashion, ensuring that one slow service doesn't impact the entire system.

**Data Flow:**

1. A client sends a request to Vanguard.
2. **Authentication Middleware** intercepts the request to validate credentials (e.g., an API key in the header).
3. **Rate Limiting Middleware** then checks against rules defined for the route, querying **Redis** to see if the client has exceeded their request quota. If so, it immediately returns a `429 Too Many Requests` error.
4. The **Dynamic Routing Engine** matches the request path (e.g., `/users/...`) to a configured backend service (`user-service`).
5. Vanguard uses its internal, real-time routing table (populated by the **Service Discovery** module) to find the internal IP and port of a healthy `user-service` pod.
6. The original request is then proxied to the target service. The response is streamed back to the client through Vanguard.

## Core Features

- **Asynchronous Core**: Built on FastAPI and `httpx` for non-blocking I/O, capable of handling thousands of concurrent connections.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Configure routes through a simple YAML file, mapping URL paths to backend services.
- **Kubernetes Service Discovery**: Automatically discovers and registers services deployed within the Kubernetes cluster by watching the K8s API server, eliminating the need for manual configuration.
- **High-Performance Rate Limiting**: Implements a distributed sliding window log algorithm using Redis to enforce precise rate limits across multiple gateway instances.
- **Pluggable Middleware**: Easily extendable with custom middleware for authentication, logging, and request transformation.
- **Configuration as Code**: All routing and policy configurations are defined in a simple, version-controllable YAML file.

## Configuration

Vanguard is configured via a central `config.yaml` file that defines all routes and their associated policies.

**Example `config.yaml`:**

YAML

# 

`# The port Vanguard will listen on.
server:
  port: 8000

# Defines all available routes.
routes:
  - id: user-service-route
    # The URL prefix that triggers this route.
    path_prefix: /users
    # The name of the Kubernetes service to forward traffic to.
    # Must match the 'name' in the K8s Service manifest.
    service_name: user-service
    # Optional authentication policy.
    auth_required: true

  - id: order-service-route
    path_prefix: /orders
    service_name: order-service
    auth_required: true
    # Optional rate limiting policy.
    rate_limit:
      # Number of requests allowed per period.
      requests_per_period: 100
      # The time window in seconds.
      period_seconds: 60
      # The header to use for identifying the client (e.g., API-Key, IP address).
      client_identifier: "API-Key"`

## Setup & Deployment

### Prerequisites

- **Docker**
- **Kubernetes Cluster** (e.g., Minikube, Kind, or a cloud provider)
- **kubectl** configured to communicate with your cluster
- **Redis** instance accessible from the cluster

### Deployment Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**Bash
    
    # 
    
    `git clone https://github.com/your-username/vanguard-gateway.git
    cd vanguard-gateway`
    
2. **Build the Docker Image:**Bash
    
    # 
    
    `docker build -t your-username/vanguard-gateway:latest .`
    
3. **Configure Kubernetes Manifests:**
    - **`deployment.yaml`**: Update the deployment file to point to your Docker image and configure environment variables (e.g., Redis host, path to config file).
    - **`configmap.yaml`**: Place your `config.yaml` routing rules inside the ConfigMap.
    - **`rbac.yaml`**: This file contains the necessary permissions (ClusterRole and RoleBinding) for Vanguard to access the Kubernetes API and discover services. **This is critical for service discovery to work.**
4. Deploy to Kubernetes:Bash
    
    Apply the manifest files to your cluster.
    
    # 
    
    `# Apply permissions first
    kubectl apply -f k8s/rbac.yaml
    
    # Apply the configuration
    kubectl apply -f k8s/configmap.yaml
    
    # Deploy the gateway
    kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
    kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml`
    
    The `service.yaml` should create a `LoadBalancer` or `NodePort` service to expose Vanguard to external traffic.
